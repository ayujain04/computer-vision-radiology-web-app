# small_ML_radiology_application
Built out, trained and deployed best small machine learning model (after testing) to triage frontal chest x-rays.

Bootstrapped application using Anvil (allows you to build application with only Python code, as I was in a time crunch and only was familiar with Python at the time). 

Web app available at this link:

In order to run this application, server hosting the model through jupyter notebook must be running.

Wrote a research paper on the development of the models (posted in the repository). 

Invited to present to high school students on how to get involved with machine learning, resources to learn computer vision, and explained my models at a high level.
